I originally created this project to allow a fast way of adding records to an existing Couchbase Lite DB to do some load testing, and to test the search capability, etc. on an IPhone application I wrote.  This program should work with Couchbase Lite version 2.X.  How I used this program was to launch the IPhone app I wrote in the simulator, created an entry, exited the application, copied the DB to another location and opened it with this program.  I added a whole bunch of new entries and copied it back the database back the original location.  I thought this would be faster than using the appication itself since I could copy the tables and make a few changes.
